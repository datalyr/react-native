## [1.0.6] - 2025-06-23

### üîë CRITICAL FIX - API Authentication Added

**BREAKING CHANGE**: API key is now required for authentication.

#### Added
- **API Key Authentication**: Added required `apiKey` field to `DatalyrConfig`
- **HTTP Authorization**: SDK now sends `Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}` header
- **401 Error Fix**: Resolves authentication errors with Datalyr API endpoints

#### Changed
- **DatalyrConfig Interface**: Added required `apiKey: string` field
- **HttpClient**: Updated to include API key in request headers
- **SDK Initialization**: Now validates both `workspaceId` and `apiKey`

#### Migration Guide
Update your SDK initialization to include the API key:

```typescript
// OLD (v1.0.5 and earlier)
await datalyr.initialize({
  workspaceId: 'your-workspace-id'
});

// NEW (v1.0.6+) - API key required
await datalyr.initialize({
  workspaceId: 'your-workspace-id',
  apiKey: 'dk_your_api_key'  // Get from Datalyr dashboard
});
```

**Where to find your API key:**
- Check your web tracking script tag
- Look for `data-api-key="dk_..."` attribute
- Contact support if you need help locating it

#### Technical Details
- API keys follow format: `dk_` + random string
- Keys are safe to include in client-side code (write-only permissions)
- Similar to Google Analytics tracking IDs or Mixpanel project tokens

## [1.0.5] - 2025-01-23

### üîÑ Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed automatic screen tracking event name from `screen_view` to `pageviews` for consistency with web analytics
- Updated session tracking to report `pageviews` instead of `screen_views` in session end events
- Updated session property names: `screen_views_in_session` ‚Üí `pageviews_in_session`

### üêõ Fixed  
- Fixed SDK export pattern to use singleton instance instead of class constructor
- Resolved white screen issues caused by incorrect import/export patterns
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in example files

### üìö Documentation
- Updated all documentation to reflect `pageviews` instead of `screen_view`
- Updated README.md, INSTALL.md, and EXPO_INSTALL.md
- Updated SDK_COMPLETION_STATUS.md to show correct event names
- Updated example files to use correct singleton import pattern
- Updated example UI text to show "Pageview" instead of "Screen View"

### üîß Technical Details
- Auto-events manager now tracks `pageviews` events for screen navigation
- Main SDK `screen()` method now tracks `pageviews` events
- Maintains backward compatibility for session tracking (still counts as `screenViews` internally)
- Fixed import pattern: `import { datalyr } from '@datalyr/react-native-sdk'`

### üéØ Impact
- **Web Analytics Consistency**: Mobile screen tracking now uses the same event name (`pageviews`) as web page tracking
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Fixed white screen issues and import errors
- **Better Analytics**: Unified event naming makes cross-platform analytics easier
